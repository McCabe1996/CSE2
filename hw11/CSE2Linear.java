//Write a program called CSE2Linear.java that prompts the user to enter 15 
//ints for studentsâ€™ final grades in CSE2. Check that the user only enters 
//ints, and print an error message if the user enters anything other than an 
//int.  Print a different error message for an int that is out of the range 
//from 0-100, and finally a third error message if the int is not greater 
//than or equal to the last int.  Print the final input array.  Next, prompt
//the user to enter a grade to be searched for. implement a binary search 
//to find the entered grade. Indicate if the grade was found or not, and 
//print out the number of iterations used. 
//Next, scramble the sorted array randomly, and print out the scrambled array.
//Prompt the user again to enter an int to be searched for, and use linear 
//search to find the grade. Indicate if the grade was found or not, and 
//how many iterations it took.
